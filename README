To run you must have

1. Maven built
2. JSword (http://www.crosswire.org/jsword) built and installed to your local Maven repository

To build and deploy, simply

1. mvn package
2. java -jar target/jacknife-<version>.jar -- <host>
By default the system will bind to 'localhost' and be unaccessible from remote addresses.
(the origin-jacknife-<version>.jar does not have all the dependencies bundled)

To connect via REST-like services, just point your favorite HTTP client to
http://<host>:10001/ for a list of installed SWORD modules. To get specific top-level key values,
append the module ID to the path. E.g. http://<host>:10001/KJV/. To get a specific set of values
printed out, try http://<host>:10001/KJV/Isaiah.1 in order to retrieve all of the first chapter
of Isaiah in JSON format.

To connect to WebSockets, open a connection to ws://<host>:10002/. Send any blank message to retrieve
a list of modules. Send a message in the form {"module":"KJV"} to get a list of available top-level
values. Send a message such as {"module":"KJV","key":"John"} to retrieve the entire gospel of John.
